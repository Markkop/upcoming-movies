## Challenges/Wishlist

### React State Management

At first I thought that `useState` hooks would be enought to manage states for this simple application, however I've considered using Redux when developping the Movie Details Modal and even the Query/setQuery states. However it would looked being too much and I went for a Context API and Props Drilling approach, respectively.  
I'd like to have this [Mark Erikson video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zySeP5vH9c) about Redux and his draft [React cheatsheet](https://react-community-tools-practices-cheatsheet.netlify.app/state-management/overview) about State Managment for future references. Really cool material.

### Layout Design

UI and UX are not my strong points, so I've used MaterialUI to help me for a faster development. It surelly worked, but sometimes I've wished using my own components for a better understanding on how tags and styles were working

### Shared package 

There were times where I wanted to use the same types I've declared on both client and server applications and it sound tempting creating a new package just for this. In the end, I've just imported it directly from the other package.
